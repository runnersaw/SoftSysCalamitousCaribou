## Software Systems Calamitous Caribou

#### Sawyer Vaughan, Deniz Celik, Chris Wallace

This repository contains the supporting code and website for our project and exploring C exploits. We investigated a plethora of different options and implemented a few basic exploits before creating write-ups of exploiting vulnerable code at [exploit-exercises.com](https://exploit-exercises.com/). You can find more detailed info in our [final report](http://sawyervaughan.com/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/).

To get started with our code, read the README associated with the project for instructions on that particular program. As a base we recommend an Ubuntu VM (14.04/16.04, either is fine), with a text editor you are comfortable in and included programming libraries/languages (Python, C, gcc).

For the Protostar and Nebula exercises, see the instructions at [exploit-exercises.com](https://exploit-exercises.com/) for how to get started.
