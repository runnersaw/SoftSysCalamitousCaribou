## Goal

To override the `modified` variable.

## Source Code

stack0.c

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

## Exploit

`gets` is like `raw_input` in python. It retrieves user input and stores it in the array pointed to by `buffer`. However, `gets` doesn't
perform any bounds checking, so entering 65 a's will actually overflow the buffer and store the final 'a' at the location of `modified`,
thus modifying `modified`.
