## Protostar Exploits

A collection of exercises that we found at [exploit-exercises.com](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/) to be useful for learning about C exploit techniques:

#### [Stack 0](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/stack0.md)

In Stack 0, we learn about using a buffer overflow to modify an integer on the stack.

#### [Stack 3](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/stack3.md)

In Stack 3, we learn about using `objdump` to find the address of a function, and using a buffer overflow to override a function pointer in order to call this function.

#### [Stack 4](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/stack4.md)

In Stack 4, we learn about using a buffer overflow to override the return address of a function.

#### [Stack 6](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/stack6.md)

In Stack 6, we learn about overriding the return address to point to a function on the heap rather than the stack.

#### [Format 0](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/format0.md)

In Format 0, we learn about using a format string to override a variable on the stack.

#### [Heap 0](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/heap0.md)

In Heap 0, we learn about using a buffer overflow to override variables on the heap.

#### [Heap 1](https://github.com/runnersaw/SoftSysCalamitousCaribou/blob/master/Security/protostarExploits/heap1.md)

In Heap 1, we learn about using buffer overflows in the heap to override the return address of functions in order to call arbitrary functions.
