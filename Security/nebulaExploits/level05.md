###Level 05



####Introduction
We are given the following prompt:
> Check the flag05 home directory. You are looking for weak directory permissions

####Exploit
The directory `home/flag05/.backup`  has weak permissions that gives any user read or write permissions. Using this I was able to
locate a tar file and extract the old ssh keys from that tar file. `tar -xzvf backup-19072011.tgz -C /home/level05`
Now I am free to ssh into the same machine using `ssh flag05@localhost` as long as I was in the directory I extracted the keys to

####Credits
I found the `.backup` directory with a tar file but I basically had no idea how to proceed from there so I found this 
[walkthrough](https://www.mattandreko.com/2011/12/06/exploit-exercises-nebula-05/) and now understand how this would work
