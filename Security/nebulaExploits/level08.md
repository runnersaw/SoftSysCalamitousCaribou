## Goal

Call `getflag` from the `flag08` account.

## Situation

In this example, there is a `.pcap` file in the `/home/flag08` directory. A quick Google shows that a .pcap file is a packet capture, so
we need to figure out how to dump it.

## Exploit

To dump the file, we can run `tcpflow -c -r capture.pcap`. This shows us that the packets sent look like the following: 
`backdoor...00Rm8.ate`. Trying `backdoor` and `backdoor...00Rm8.ate` don't work as passwords. However, if you interpret the '.' as
a backspace, you can see that the password is `backd00Rmate`. Now you can log into the `flag08` account.
