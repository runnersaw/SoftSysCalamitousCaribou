## Goal

Call `getflag` with the `flag06` account.

## Situation

The flag06 account was created on a legacy Unix system.

## Exploit

On old Unix systems, the OS stored a hash of the password in /etc/passwd. Now, the OS only stores an 'x' in that file, and shadows the
password hashes into another file. 

In this case, displaying the contents of /etc/passwd gives:

```
flag06:ueqwOCnSGdsuM:993:993::/home/flag06:/bin/sh
```

We can use a [password cracker](http://www.openwall.com/john/) to get a password with that hash. 
This particular password cracker tells us that the password for the flag06 account is `hello`.
Now we can log into the flag06 account and execute `getflag`.
