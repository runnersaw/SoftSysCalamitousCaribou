##Level 02
###Introduction
In orer to complete this exercise we must run the `getflag` command with the user `flag02`. We are told to exploit the below code 

```language-c
include <stdlib.h>
include <unistd.h>
include <string.h>
include <sys/types.h>
include <stdio.h>
 
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)
{
  char *buffer;
 
  gid_t gid;
  uid_t uid;
 
  gid = getegid();
  uid = geteuid();
 
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  setresuid(uid, uid, uid);
 
  buffer = NULL;
 
  asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));
  printf("about to call system(\"%s\")\n", buffer);
  
  system(buffer);
}
```
This code is an SUID program meaning that it is ran as a different user. In our case that user is `flag02`. 
###Exploit
The line `asprintf(&buffer, "/bin/echo %s is cool", getenv("USER"));` is vulnerable. The program calls echo with the environment
variable 'USER'. We can set the environment variable USER to be the `getflag` commmand and when buffer is executed we will run our command.  

If we run the command `export USER=";getflag;"` the system call will look like `/bin/echo ;getflag; is cool`. While the last command is 
garbage we will be able to successfully run the `getflag` command as the `flag02` user
